# Dashboard

The Catena Dashboard is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application built to configure and interface with the Catena Tools backend. 
While it is responsible for Admin panels it also provides a few additional features including a public facing [Account Linking](Account-Linking.md) page.
